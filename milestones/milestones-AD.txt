Time log:
    11:00 - 1:00 Friday, 9/27: I created the Vite React project and research other libraies to
    use for the frontend. I decided to imporporate SASS, framer motion, possibly d3.js to this project to
    make the front end look professional.

    2:00-4:00 Saturday, 9/28: I started researching how I wanted to design my control panel. So I looked 
    up "control panel dashboard ui ux" and found some great inspiration. I took 4 designs I liked and started to create a 
    Figma to designed the fornt end. I spent a large amount of time deciding and design how I wanted my front end to look in 
    Figma so I don't waste any time while I am developing.

able to distinguish between different commands and control the car accordingly. 
+10 points: Web application also functions as intended (displays current command, live updates with sockets implemented correctly, etc).
+5 points: time tracking (time adds up and assigned tasks match the logs)

Report:
    I think this challenge went well. I was able to get a foundation for how I wanted to structure my front end 
    and what elements I wanted to include or leave out. I hope to round out my stack during this project and really 
    incorporate important design concepts to bring my experience to an intermediate level. My next step will be to 
    get started on the front end and get a good sense of what the front-end will look like. I want to completely 
    finish my Figma design and iron out all of the details.
